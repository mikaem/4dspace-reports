In Fig.00 the electron density, the ion density and potential distribution are shown.
(magnetic field direction at 0 degree to the z-axis, in the xz-plane)
The main simulation parameter is shown in Table1.
In this case, plasma flow vector is x-axis. And conductivity object is set in a center as a rocket.
The most obvious feature of these Figures is a wake, behind the rocket.
This region of low potential behind the rocket indicates that electrons are more often penetrating behind the rocket
 in this case.
It is also shown Fig.01.(the particle number's 1 dimentional distribution at z=64)
This will be discussed in more detail when we look at the other magnetic field angle's case.
And another notable feature is Mach cone.
We calucurate Mach cone angle É (1).
É  = sin^-1 (1/M)  (1)
In this case, the Mach angle is nearly 30 degree. And we can see the angle is correspond to the figures.


Table1
Grid width   1 (cm)
Mach number  2
Electron temperature  3000(K)
Ion temperature       2000(K)
Plasma flow speed     40000(m/s)
Magnetic field         50  (microT)

In Fig.02 current density is shown. We can see almost ion currents go straight if they hit the rocket.(Fig.02(a))
And the electron currents twin arround the rocket. (Fig.02(b)) 
Finally the sum of electrons and ions current is also twinning arround the rocket.(Fig.02(c))
